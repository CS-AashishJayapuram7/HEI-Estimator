# 🌟 Beacon of Hope(Extension) – HEI Estimator from Meal Images

## Project Overview
This project extends the [*Beacon of Hope*](https://github.com/SCCapstone/beacon-of-hope) web application by adding an AI-powered **Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2020) estimator** from a single meal image.  
The system will use computer vision and nutrition science to:
1. Detect and recognize foods from a meal image  
2. Estimate portion sizes  
3. Convert foods to nutrient and food-group equivalents using USDA data  
4. Compute the HEI-2020 score using the official USDA scoring methodology  
5. Return a structured JSON output for integration into Beacon of Hope  

This work aligns machine learning with public health and nutritional policy standards.
